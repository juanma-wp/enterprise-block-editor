# Security Best Practices for Blocks

Security is a fundamental aspect of WordPress development, especially when developing custom blocks for the Block Editor. 

As block developers, we are responsible for ensuring that our blocks handle data securely, validate user input properly, and restrict functionality based on user capabilities. 

In this lesson, we'll explore essential security best practices that should be implemented in every block you develop.

## Understanding Security in Block Development

Block development introduces unique security challenges because blocks often handle user input, store data in the database, and render dynamic content on the frontend. Without proper security measures, blocks can become vectors for various attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and unauthorized access to functionality.

WordPress developers are encouraged to follow these security practices:

**Don’t trust any data**. 

Don’t trust user input, third-party APIs, or data in your database without verification. Protection of your WordPress themes begins with ensuring the data entering and leaving your theme is as intended. Always make sure to validate and sanitize user input fore using it, and to escape on output.

**Rely on WordPress APIs**.

Many core WordPress APIs provide built-in functionality for validating and sanitizing data. Rely on the WordPress provided APIs whenever possible.

**Keep your code up to date**. 

As technology evolves, so does the potential for new security holes in your plugin or theme. Stay vigilant by maintaining your code and updating as required.

## Relying on WordPress APIs

As a primarily JavaScript powered environment, the Block Editor, and more specifically, the [WordPress Data Layer](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/data/) powered by the `@wordpress/data` package, makes use of the default [WordPress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) endpoints and the `@wordpress/api-fetch` [package](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-api-fetch/) to send and receive data from the WordPress database.

As much as possible, you should rely on these APIs to handle the storage and retrieval of any data needed to power your block's functionality. By extension, this means using core WordPress data APIs like Custom Post Types, Post Meta, and Taxonomies for your block's data storage needs.

This will ensure that data is validated and sanitized before being saved to the database, escaped before being returned to your block, and that any requests made include proper security checks.

There are, however, some additional security measures that you can implement in your block development workflow to ensure that your block code is secure.

## Validating Block Attributes

While block attributes will already be validated before being processed by the data layer, it's still a good idea to validate them before saving.

In your block's `edit` function, you can implement basic validation before updating an attribute:

```javascript
const MyBlockEdit = ({ attributes, setAttributes }) => {
    const { title } = attributes;

    const updateTitle = (newTitle) => {
        // Basic validation
        if (newTitle.length > 100) {
            // Notify user of error
            return;
        }
        setAttributes({ title: newTitle });
    };

    return (
        <TextControl
            label="Title"
            value={title}
            onChange={updateTitle}
        />
    );
};
```

This helps by checking that data is within expected bounds before making the request to update the block's attribute.

## Escaping in Content

When working with dynamic data in your block's edit or save functions, use the appropriate escaping methods to prevent XSS attacks.

For example, there's a `@wordpress/escape-html` [package](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-escape-html/) that provides functions for escaping HTML and attributes:

```javascript
import { escapeHTML, escapeAttribute } from '@wordpress/escape-html';

const MyBlockSave = ({ attributes }) => {
    const { title, description } = attributes;

    return (
        <div className="my-block">
            <h2>{escapeHTML(title)}</h2>
            <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: escapeHTML(description) }} />
        </div>
    );
};
```

Notice the use of the React `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` [property](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/common#dangerously-setting-the-inner-html) to render the escaped HTML content. 

dangerouslySetInnerHTML allows you to render HTML markup as HTML, instead of as text. The name makes it sound like it’s dangerous to use, but in this example, it’s safe because the data is being escaped.

WordPress core also uses this property in the Block Editor to render the content of the post in the editor.

## Escaping Dynamic Output

When rendering block content for a dynamic block, always use the appropriate escaping function:

```php
/**
 * Render callback for my custom block.
 *
 * @param array    $attributes Block attributes.
 * @param string   $content    Block content.
 * @param WP_Block $block      Block instance.
 * @return string  Rendered block output.
 */
function render_my_block( $attributes, $content, $block ) {
    $title = isset( $attributes['title'] ) ? $attributes['title'] : '';
    $url = isset( $attributes['url'] ) ? $attributes['url'] : '';
    
    $output = '';
    $output .= '' . esc_html( $title ) . '';
    $output .= '' . esc_html__( 'Learn More', 'my-text-domain' ) . '';
    $output .= '';
    
    return $output;
}
```

WordPress provides several [escaping functions](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/security/escaping/) for different contexts:

- `esc_html()` - Use when outputting plain text with no HTML allowed
- `esc_attr()` - Use when outputting data within HTML attributes
- `esc_url()` - Use when outputting URLs (links, image sources, etc.)
- `esc_js()` - Use when outputting data within JavaScript
- `wp_kses()` and `wp_kses_post()` - Use when you need to allow specific HTML tags

## Validating User Roles and Capabilities

WordPress ships with a robust system of roles and capabilities that determine what actions users can perform:

- **Roles** are collections of capabilities (e.g., Administrator, Editor, Author)
- **Capabilities** are specific permissions (e.g., can edit posts, can publish posts, can manage options)

Access to the Block Editor, and therefore block functionality, is controlled by these roles and capabilities. For example, only Administrators can access the Site Editor or edit Pages, while Editors can only edit Posts.

It can, however, be useful to also check for specific capabilities within your block code to restrict access to certain features or functionality.

### Checking User Capabilities in PHP

One of the benefits of using WordPress is that you can check user capabilities in any PHP code:

```php
add_action( 'init', 'vip_learn_custom_block_init' );

function vip_learn_custom_block_init() {
	if ( current_user_can( 'manage_options' ) ) {
		register_block_type( __DIR__ . '/build' );
	}
}
```

Here the `current_user_can()` function checks if the current user has the `manage_options` capability, which is typically reserved for Administrators. If the user has this capability, the custom block is registered.

### Checking Capabilities in JavaScript

In the Block Editor, you can use the `@wordpress/core-data` package to check current user capabilities:

```javascript
import { useSelect } from '@wordpress/data';
import { store as coreStore } from '@wordpress/core-data';

function Edit({ attributes, setAttributes }) {
    const canPublishPosts = useSelect(select => {
        return select(coreStore).canUser('create', 'posts');
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
            {canPublishPosts ? (
                <Button
                    onClick={() => {
                        // Perform action that requires publish_posts capability
                    }}
                >
                    Publish
                </Button>
            ) : (
                <p>You don't have permission to publish posts.</p>
            )}
        </div>
    );
}

```

### Restricting Block Features Based on Capabilities

You can conditionally render block controls or features based on user capabilities:

```javascript
import { useSelect } from '@wordpress/data';
import { store as coreStore } from '@wordpress/core-data';

function MyBlockEdit({ attributes, setAttributes }) {
    const { canEditPosts, canManageOptions } = useSelect(select => {
        return {
            canEditPosts: select(coreStore).canUser('update', 'posts'),
            canManageOptions: select(coreStore).canUser('update', 'settings')
        };
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
            <TextControl
                label="Title"
                value={attributes.title}
                onChange={(title) => setAttributes({ title })}
            />

            {canEditPosts && (
                <TextControl
                    label="Advanced Setting"
                    value={attributes.advancedSetting}
                    onChange={(advancedSetting) => setAttributes({ advancedSetting })}
                />
            )}

            {canManageOptions && (
                <ToggleControl
                    label="Admin-only Setting"
                    checked={attributes.adminSetting}
                    onChange={(adminSetting) => setAttributes({ adminSetting })}
                />
            )}
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Custom Capabilities for Blocks

For more granular control, you can add custom capabilities to specific roles to perform specific capability checks:

```php
register_activation_hook( __FILE__, 'add_block_capabilities' );

/**
 * Add custom capability for managing specific blocks.
 */
function add_block_capabilities() {
    // Add the capability to the administrator role
    $role = get_role( 'administrator' );
    if ( $role ) {
        $role->add_cap( 'manage_custom_blocks' );
    }
    
    // Optionally add to editor role
    $editor_role = get_role( 'editor' );
    if ( $editor_role ) {
        $editor_role->add_cap( 'manage_custom_blocks' );
    }
}


/**
 * Check for custom block capability.
 */
function user_can_manage_custom_blocks() {
    return current_user_can( 'manage_custom_blocks' );
}
```

Then use this function to conditionally register blocks.

```php
add_action( 'init', 'vip_learn_custom_block_init' );

function vip_learn_custom_block_init() {
	if ( user_can_manage_custom_blocks() ) {
		register_block_type( __DIR__ . '/build' );
	}
}
```

## Conclusion

Security is a critical aspect of block development that should never be an afterthought. By implementing proper data validation, output escaping, and capability checks, you can create blocks that are both functional and secure.

Remember the key principles:
- Validate early, escape late
- Never trust user input
- Use the appropriate sanitization and escaping functions for each context
- Always check user capabilities before allowing actions

These practices will help protect your WordPress sites from common security vulnerabilities and ensure that your blocks contribute positively to the overall security posture of the sites where they're installed.
