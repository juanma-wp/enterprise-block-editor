# Overview of the @wordpress/components Package

The @wordpress/components package is the foundation of WordPress block development. This library of reusable user interface (UI) components is designed to create consistent and accessible user experience across the block editor.

## Introduction to Common Reusable Components

The @wordpress/components package offers a wide array of UI elements that developers can leverage to build sophisticated interfaces quickly and efficiently. Some of the most frequently used components include:

**Button**: A versatile component for creating clickable elements with various styles and behaviors.

**TextControl**: An input field for single-line text entry, often used for titles or short form inputs.

**SelectControl**: A dropdown menu component for selecting from predefined options.

**ToggleControl**: A switch-like component for binary choices, typically used for enabling or disabling features.

**RichText**: A powerful component for handling editable rich text content within blocks.

These components are just a small sample of the extensive library available. The @wordpress/components package includes everything from basic form elements to complex UI structures like modals, popovers, and tooltips.

## Benefits of Using Prebuilt Components

Utilizing the prebuilt components from the @wordpress/components package offers several significant advantages for WordPress developers:

1. **Consistency**: By using standardized components, developers ensure a consistent look and feel across the WordPress admin interface, enhancing usability and user experience[4].

2. **Accessibility**: The components are built with accessibility in mind, helping developers create interfaces that are usable by all, including those with disabilities[2].

3. **Time Efficiency**: Prebuilt components significantly reduce development time by eliminating the need to create common UI elements from scratch[5].

4. **Maintainability**: As these components are part of the core WordPress ecosystem, they are regularly updated and maintained, ensuring long-term compatibility and performance[3].

5. **Community Support**: Being part of the WordPress core, these components benefit from extensive documentation and community support, making troubleshooting and learning easier[2][3].

## Example: Using the RichText Component in a WordPress Block

To illustrate the practical application of a prebuilt component, let's examine how the RichText component can be used within a custom block:

To start, use create-block to scaffold a new block. 

```shell
npx @wordpress/create-block --namespace vip-learn custom-rich-text
```

Open the block's block.json file, and add an attribute:

```json
"attributes": {
    "content": {
        "type": "string",
        "source": "html",
        "selector": "p"
    }
},
```

This is the attribute that will store the block's content from the RichText component.

Next, open the block's Edit component file (edit.js) and import the RichText component:

```javascript
import { useBlockProps, RichText } from '@wordpress/block-editor';
```

Then update the Edit component to use the RichText component and the block attributes to create an editable text area in the editor:

```javascript
export default function Edit( { attributes, setAttributes } ) {
    const onChangeContent = ( content ) => {
        setAttributes( { content } );
    };
    return (
        <RichText
            { ...useBlockProps()}
            value={ attributes.content }
            onChange={ onChangeContent }
        />
    );
}
```

In this example, the `attributes` prop and `setAttributes` function are destructured in the `Edit` component. The `RichText` component is used to create an editable text area in the block. The `RichText` component has an `onChange` event handler that calls the `onChangeContent` function to update the block's content attribute using the `setAttributes` function whenever the text is modified.

You will also need to update the `save` function to render the `RichText` component with the content stored in the block's attributes:

```javascript
import { useBlockProps, RichText } from '@wordpress/block-editor';
export default function save( { attributes } ) {
	return (
		<RichText.Content
			{ ...useBlockProps.save() }
			value={ attributes.content }
		/>
	);
}
```
