# Multisite Considerations for Block Development

WordPress Multisite represents a sophisticated approach to managing multiple websites from a single WordPress installation. When developing blocks for enterprise environments that utilize Multisite networks, developers face unique challenges and considerations that don't exist in standard WordPress installations. Understanding these nuances is essential for creating blocks that function correctly, maintain appropriate permission structures, and deliver consistent user experiences across an entire network of sites.

## Understanding WordPress Multisite Architecture

Before diving into block development considerations, it's important to grasp how WordPress Multisite fundamentally works. Multisite allows you to create a network of websites under a single WordPress installation, sharing the same core files and database while maintaining separate content[^5].

In a Multisite environment, you have a network-wide Super Admin role that oversees the entire installation, while individual sites can have their own administrators with more limited permissions[^3][^6]. This hierarchical structure impacts how blocks are deployed, managed, and secured across your network.

When developing blocks for Multisite, you must consider that:

1. All sites share the same codebase, including plugin and theme files
2. Each site has its own database tables for content but shares user tables
3. Plugin and theme activation can occur network-wide or on individual sites
4. Permissions and capabilities can vary significantly between sites

These architectural characteristics directly impact how your blocks will behave across different sites in your network.

## Global vs. Site-Specific Blocks

### Understanding Block Registration in Multisite

In WordPress, blocks are typically registered using the `register_block_type()` function. In a Multisite environment, this registration occurs within the shared codebase, making the block technically available to all sites. However, this doesn't mean all sites should necessarily have access to every block.

The distinction between global and site-specific blocks often comes down to how you control access and visibility rather than separate codebases. Since all sites in the network share the same plugin files, you need to implement conditional logic to determine when and where blocks appear.

### Creating Global Blocks

Global blocks are those that should be available across your entire network of sites. These typically include fundamental content blocks, branded components, or enterprise-wide design elements that maintain consistency.

When developing global blocks, consider the following approaches:

```php
/**
 * Register a global block available to all sites in the network.
 */
function enterprise_register_global_blocks() {
    // This block will be available to all sites in the network.
    register_block_type(
        plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ ) . 'build/global-cta-block'
    );
}
add_action( 'init', 'enterprise_register_global_blocks' );
```

Global blocks should be designed with flexibility to accommodate different site contexts while maintaining brand consistency. You might include attributes that allow for limited customization while preserving critical brand elements.

### Implementing Site-Specific Blocks

For blocks that should only appear on certain sites within your network, you'll need to implement conditional registration or visibility. There are several approaches to achieve this:

1. **Conditional Registration Based on Site ID:**
```php
/**
 * Register blocks only for specific sites in the network.
 */
function enterprise_register_site_specific_blocks() {
    // Get the current site ID.
    $site_id = get_current_blog_id();
    
    // Array of site IDs that should have access to this specialized block.
    $allowed_sites = [ 2, 5, 9 ];
    
    if ( in_array( $site_id, $allowed_sites, true ) ) {
        register_block_type(
            plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ ) . 'build/specialized-department-block'
        );
    }
}
add_action( 'init', 'enterprise_register_site_specific_blocks' );
```

2. **Using Network Options for Configuration:**

You can create a network admin interface that allows the Super Admin to configure which blocks are available on which sites. This approach offers more flexibility than hardcoding site IDs.

```php
/**
 * Register blocks based on network settings.
 */
function enterprise_register_configurable_blocks() {
    $site_id = get_current_blog_id();
    
    // Get network option that stores block configurations.
    $network_block_config = get_site_option( 'enterprise_block_availability', [] );
    
    if ( isset( $network_block_config[ $site_id ] ) &amp;&amp; in_array( 'specialized-block', $network_block_config[ $site_id ], true ) ) {
        register_block_type(
            plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ ) . 'build/specialized-block'
        );
    }
}
add_action( 'init', 'enterprise_register_configurable_blocks' );
```


### Block Asset Management Across Network

When developing blocks for a Multisite environment, asset management becomes more complex. Your JavaScript and CSS files need to account for potential variations between sites. For example, you might need to adjust styling based on the site's theme or load different data sources.

Consider implementing a configuration system that allows your blocks to adapt to different site contexts:

```javascript
// In your block's edit.js file
import { useSelect } from '@wordpress/data';

export default function Edit( { attributes, setAttributes } ) {
    const siteInfo = useSelect( ( select ) =&gt; {
        return select( 'core' ).getSite();
    }, [] );
    
    // Adapt block behavior based on site context
    const isCorporateSite = siteInfo.id === 1; // Main corporate site
    
    return (
        <div>
            {/* Block content adapts based on site context */}
        </div>
    );
}
```

This approach allows your blocks to respond intelligently to the specific site where they're being used, providing a tailored experience while maintaining a single codebase.

## Customizing Block Permissions Based on User Roles Across Sites

In an enterprise Multisite environment, managing who can use which blocks becomes critical for maintaining governance and content standards. WordPress Multisite offers several ways to implement role-based block permissions.

### Understanding User Roles in Multisite

Multisite extends WordPress's role system with the addition of the Super Admin role. A typical permission hierarchy in Multisite might look like:

1. Super Admin - Controls the entire network
2. Site Administrator - Manages an individual site
3. Editor, Author, Contributor, etc. - Standard WordPress roles with varying permissions

When implementing block permissions, you need to consider this extended hierarchy and how it impacts block usage across your network.

### Programmatic Approaches to Block Permissions

You can programmatically control block permissions by filtering the block editor settings:

```php
/**
 * Customize available blocks based on user role and site.
 *
 * @param array $settings The editor settings.
 * @param array $context The post editor context.
 * @return array Filtered settings.
 */
function enterprise_filter_allowed_blocks( $settings, $context ) {
    // Get current user and site info.
    $user = wp_get_current_user();
    $site_id = get_current_blog_id();
    
    // If user is a super admin, don't restrict blocks.
    if ( is_super_admin() ) {
        return $settings;
    }
    
    // Define restricted blocks for certain roles.
    $restricted_blocks = [
        'core/html', // Restrict HTML block
        'core/shortcode', // Restrict shortcode block
    ];
    
    // If user is only an author, add more restrictions.
    if ( in_array( 'author', $user-&gt;roles, true ) ) {
        $restricted_blocks = array_merge( $restricted_blocks, [
            'core/cover',
            'core/media-text',
        ] );
    }
    
    // Different sites might have different restrictions.
    if ( $site_id === 2 &amp;&amp; in_array( 'editor', $user-&gt;roles, true ) ) {
        // Special restrictions for editors on site ID 2.
        $restricted_blocks[] = 'core/columns';
    }
    
    // Filter the allowed blocks list.
    if ( isset( $settings['allowedBlockTypes'] ) &amp;&amp; is_array( $settings['allowedBlockTypes'] ) ) {
        $settings['allowedBlockTypes'] = array_filter(
            $settings['allowedBlockTypes'],
            function( $block_name ) use ( $restricted_blocks ) {
                return ! in_array( $block_name, $restricted_blocks, true );
            }
        );
    }
    
    return $settings;
}
add_filter( 'block_editor_settings_all', 'enterprise_filter_allowed_blocks', 10, 2 );
```

This approach gives you fine-grained control over which blocks are available to which users on which sites.

### Leveraging Plugins for Block Permissions

For enterprise environments, you might consider using specialized plugins to manage block permissions across your Multisite network. PublishPress Capabilities is one such solution that provides tools for standardizing permissions across sites[^8].

For example, using PublishPress Blocks, you can control which user roles can add specific Gutenberg blocks while editing content[^4]. This creates a consistent governance system across your network:

1. Install and network-activate the PublishPress Capabilities plugin
2. From the main network site, configure default block permissions for each role
3. Use the "include in new sites" option to apply these settings to new sites
4. Use the "sync role to all sites now" option to apply settings to all existing sites[^8]

This approach provides a user-friendly interface for managing block permissions without requiring custom code.

### Implementing Site-Specific Permission Overrides

In some cases, you might want to allow certain sites to override network-wide block permission settings. You can create a custom solution for this:

```php
/**
 * Allow site admins to override certain block restrictions.
 */
function enterprise_site_specific_block_permissions() {
    // Only run on the admin dashboard for site admins.
    if ( ! is_admin() || ! current_user_can( 'manage_options' ) ) {
        return;
    }
    
    // Handle form submission to save site-specific settings.
    if ( isset( $_POST['save_block_permissions'] ) &amp;&amp; check_admin_referer( 'site_block_permissions' ) ) {
        $allowed_blocks = isset( $_POST['site_allowed_blocks'] ) ? 
            array_map( 'sanitize_text_field', $_POST['site_allowed_blocks'] ) : 
            [];
        
        update_option( 'site_allowed_blocks', $allowed_blocks );
        
        add_action( 'admin_notices', function() {
            echo '<div><p>Block permissions updated for this site.</p></div>';
        } );
    }
    
    // Render the admin page for managing permissions.
    add_management_page(
        'Site Block Permissions',
        'Block Permissions',
        'manage_options',
        'site-block-permissions',
        'enterprise_render_block_permissions_page'
    );
}
add_action( 'admin_menu', 'enterprise_site_specific_block_permissions' );

/**
 * Render the block permissions admin page.
 */
function enterprise_render_block_permissions_page() {
    // Get currently registered blocks.
    $registered_blocks = WP_Block_Type_Registry::get_instance()-&gt;get_all_registered();
    
    // Get site-specific settings.
    $site_allowed_blocks = get_option( 'site_allowed_blocks', [] );
    
    // Output the admin interface.
    ?&gt;
    <div>
        <h1>Site-Specific Block Permissions</h1>
        <p>Configure which blocks are allowed on this specific site, overriding network defaults.</p>
        
        &lt;form method="post"&gt;
            
            &lt;table class="form-table"&gt;
                &lt;tbody&gt;
                     $block_type ) : ?&gt;
                        &lt;tr&gt;
                            &lt;th&gt;
                                &lt;label for="block-&lt;?php echo esc_attr( $block_name ); ?&gt;"&gt;
                                    title ?: $block_name ); ?&gt;
                                &lt;/label&gt;
                            &lt;/th&gt;
                            &lt;td&gt;
                                &lt;input 
                                    type="checkbox" 
                                    id="block-&lt;?php echo esc_attr( $block_name ); ?&gt;" 
                                    name="site_allowed_blocks[]" 
                                    value="&lt;?php echo esc_attr( $block_name ); ?&gt;"
                                    &lt;?php checked( in_array( $block_name, $site_allowed_blocks, true ) ); ?&gt;
                                &gt;
                            &lt;/td&gt;
                        &lt;/tr&gt;
                    
                &lt;/tbody&gt;
            &lt;/table&gt;
            
            <p>
                &lt;input type="submit" name="save_block_permissions" class="button button-primary" value="Save Block Permissions"&gt;
            </p>
        &lt;/form&gt;
    </div>
     __( 'Enterprise Blocks', 'enterprise-blocks' ),
            'icon'  =&gt; 'building',
        ]
    );
    
    // Register all enterprise blocks.
    $enterprise_blocks = [
        'corporate-header',
        'department-showcase',
        'employee-directory',
        'compliance-notice',
        'product-catalog',
    ];
    
    foreach ( $enterprise_blocks as $block ) {
        register_block_type(
            plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ ) . "build/$block"
        );
    }
}
add_action( 'init', 'enterprise_register_block_library' );
```

This approach creates a consistent set of branded blocks available to all sites in your network.

### Using Block Patterns for Multisite Governance

Block patterns can be an effective way to standardize content structures across multiple sites while still allowing for appropriate levels of customization:

```php
/**
 * Register enterprise block patterns for Multisite.
 */
function enterprise_register_block_patterns() {
    // Only register if the function exists (WordPress 5.5+).
    if ( function_exists( 'register_block_pattern_category' ) ) {
        register_block_pattern_category(
            'enterprise-layouts',
            [ 'label' =&gt; __( 'Enterprise Layouts', 'enterprise-blocks' ) ]
        );
        
        // Register a standard enterprise layout pattern.
        register_block_pattern(
            'enterprise-blocks/department-page',
            [
                'title'       =&gt; __( 'Department Page Layout', 'enterprise-blocks' ),
                'description' =&gt; __( 'Standard layout for department pages across all sites.', 'enterprise-blocks' ),
                'categories'  =&gt; [ 'enterprise-layouts' ],
                'content'     =&gt; '
                                <div>
                                    
                                    <h1>Department Name</h1>
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    <p>Department mission statement goes here.</p>
                                    
                                </div>
                                
                                
                                
                                <div>
                                    
                                    <div>
                                        
                                        <h2>About Our Department</h2>
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        <p>Department description goes here.</p>
                                        
                                    </div>
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    <div>
                                        
                                        <h3>Contact Information</h3>
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        <p>Department contact details go here.</p>
                                        
                                    </div>
                                    
                                </div>
                                '
            ]
        );
    }
}
add_action( 'init', 'enterprise_register_block_patterns' );
```

Block patterns provide a balance between standardization and flexibility, guiding content creators to use approved layouts while still allowing them to customize the content within those layouts.
